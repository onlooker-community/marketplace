# Update README Command

Update the README.md file to reflect the current state of published plugins in the marketplace.

## Instructions

1. Read `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to get the list of published plugins
2. For each plugin, inspect its directory to find:
  - Skills in `plugins/<name>/skills/`
  - Commands in `plugins/<name>/commands/`
  - Agents in `plugins/<name>/agents/`
  - Hooks in `plugins/<name>/hooks/`
3. Update the "Available Plugins" section in README.md with:
  - Plugin name (h3 heading)
  - Link to plugin's README (format: `[Plugin README](plugins/<name>/README.md)`)
  - Category from marketplace.json
  - Brief description from marketplace.json
  - "Contains:" section listing all components found
  - Installation command
4. Ensure the note about example-plugin not being published is included
5. Keep other sections (Installation, Development, License) unchanged
6. Format with Biome after updating

## Expected Output Format

For each plugin:

```markdown
### plugin-name

[Plugin README](plugins/plugin-name/README.md)

  - `skill-name` - Description

## Components to Check

**Skills:**
